           description: "This hearty dish is easy to prepare ahead of time which makes it an ideal holiday breakfast dish and a good option to serve for brunch. When you’re ready to serve, simply reheat the potatoes and spoon them on top of toast or roll up in tortillas. To make it a bigger meal, serve it with a side of steamed greens or vegetables or with a salad.",

Raise the heat to high, cover, and cook, stirring once or twice, for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook, covered, until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a sharp knife, 10 to 15 minutes. You can prepare the dish to this point up to 2 days ahead; just transfer the potato mixture to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator until ready to serve.\nTo serve, reheat over low heat if necessary. Just before serving, stir in the tomatoes, cilantro, and lime juice. Place a slice of bread on each of six plates and top them evenly with the potato scramble. Alternatively, wrap the scramble in warmed whole-grain tortillas. If desired, drizzle Hot Chile Sauce over the top or pass it in a bowl at the table.",
